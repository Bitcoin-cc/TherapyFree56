<h2>Understanding Grief</h2>
<p/>According to the Helpguide.org, "Grief is a natural, yet painful response to loss. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, but there are healthy ways to cope with the pain and express your emotions in ways that allow you to heal." Most people associate grief with the death of a loved one, but grief can be any loss the person deems significant. This can include the perceived loss of your health, the loss of a long-term relationship, the loss of a career you had been working for, or finding out that an important goal will not be possible. I's important to remember each person has a different response to grief, such as depression, anger, denial, shock, or guilt. While there are healthy ways to cope with guilt, it becomes a problem when it becomes impairing and interferes with functions of our everyday life.

<h2>Types of Grief</h2>
<h3>Abbreviated Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>This is typically the shortest lived of all 8 types of grief. The person feels that they do not have much time to grieve, and typically the loss is seen as more minor than in other situations. Moving to a new town and away from what you know can be a perceived minor grief. It is often when things have moved quickly with little time to react and process.
<h3>Anticipated Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>This is the type of grief when you know that the change or loss is coming. You may feel that you would rather avoid the situation or pretend that it is not going to happen. There is a feeling that this denial will keep the grief from occurring. In this type of grief, we often see people try and shut down their emotions as a means of coping.
<h3>Ambiguous Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>In this type of grieving, the loss is hard to explain or pinpoint. This makes it very hard to grieve the loss, as it is not clearly understood. However, if these losses build upon each other people are known to burst out crying, have uncontrollable fits, or simply shut down emotionally.
<h3>Delayed Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>This is the type of grief where a person tells themselves that they do not have time to grieve, that they have more important things to do, and that they do not have the time to grieve now. Their grief will not emerge until later when they finally have time to stop what they are doing and experience their emotions.
<h3>Exaggerated Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>This is when you have had multiple griefs that have built upon each other such as the loss of a job, the end of a relationship, and the loss of a pet. It happens when people suffer many losses and never process the grief. With this type of grief, it suddenly comes in with overwhelming feelings of depression and sadness. The individual suddenly struggles to complete tasks of everyday living.
<h3>Inhibited Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>This happens when the grief is not processed for so long, when it has been shoved down and ignored. It comes out as physical symptoms such as nausea and frequent headaches. The longer the grief is not dealt with, the worse the physical ailments.
<h3>Normal Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>The length of the grieving process varies from individual to individual. This is because we all process grief differently, and we all perceive grief differently. What one person perceives as a minor loss may be perceived as a major devastation to another.
<h3>Unresolved Grief and Mourning</h3>
<p/>These griefs are usually from our childhood. For example, this often happens when children were moved around a lot when they were little. When they did not have time to process each loss of leaving after getting settled each time. As adults they may have difficulties forming lasting relationships, feelings of rootlessness and underlying anger and resentment.
<h2>Grief Treatments</h2>
<p/>When the support of friends and family is not enough, an individual may want to consider seeing a counselor for grief. It helps the person grieving work through the normal tasks of grieving. What are some others ways that we can work to manage our grief?
<ul>
    <li>Face your feelings by getting self help and personal development books to read.
    <li>Structure your time to keep yourself busy and distracted.
    <li>Volunteer with others. Often times, giving back heals yourself as well.
    <li>Join a peer support group, so that you might get comfort and advice from those who understand your unique thoughts and feelings.
    <li>Express your grief in a creative way. Is there a special way that you can honor your loved one?
    <li>Start addressing and focusing on your physical health, as this often balances out our emotional well being.
</ul>
<h3>Grief counseling can help the individual:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Accept the loss by talking about it.
    <li>Identify and express feelings related to the loss they are suffering.
    <li>Learn to live without the person who died and to make decisions alone.
    <li>Learn to separate emotionally from the person who died and to consider the huge step of starting new relationships.
    <li>Give the person support and time to focus on grieving at notable time such as birthdays and anniversaries.
    <li>Discuss what is normal grieving and how different individuals grieve.
    <li>Provide continuous support to the individual as they navigate the process.
    <li>Help the individual to understand their personal methods of coping.
    <li>Learn to see that anger, guilt, or other negative or uncomfortable feelings can exist at the same time as more positive feelings about the person who died.
    <li>Learn to deal with the strong bonds of attachment with others.
</ul>
<p/>According to Medicine.net, in grief therapy, 6 tasks may be used to help a mourner work through grief:
<ol>    
    <li>Develop the ability to experience, express, and adjust to painful grief-related changes.
    <li>Find effective ways to cope with painful changes.
    <li>Establish a continuing relationship with the person who died.
    <li>Stay healthy and keep functioning.
    <li>Re-establish relationships and understand that others may have difficulty empathizing with the grief they experience.
    <li>Develop a healthy image of oneself and the world.
