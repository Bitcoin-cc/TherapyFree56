    <h1>How Internet-Based Therapy Is Helping Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>
    </header>


   
<article>
<p>Adults with autism spectrum disorder have historically faced difficulties accessing evidence-based care. This has been due to a variety of factors, such as communication difficulties, social anxiety, financial barriers, and transportation limitations. Because of this, many adults are not receiving the treatment they need to improve daily functioning and enhance their quality of everyday life. To overcome these barriers, recent research has focused on internet-based therapies and whether this mode of treatment has the potential to provide access to care that was previously out of reach.</p>
<h2>What Is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that typically presents in two ways: 1) difficulty with social interactions and verbal communication and 2) specific patterns of behavior and interests that are often repetitive and may be limited to certain areas. Recent studies have also shown that adults with ASD often have psychiatric comorbidities, which means they are more likely to also experience symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>ASD diagnoses are increasing, and with this increase, it is important that access to high-quality therapeutic services increases as well. Common symptoms of ASD make it more likely for adults with ASD to avoid seeking treatment (e.g.,difficulty using public transport due to perceptual sensitivity, being uncomfortable in health care settings due to communication challenges). Having to articulate needs to a stranger may be stressful for adults with ASD, especially in situations where environmental factors increase challenges.</p>
<h2>Why Might Internet-Based Therapy Be Beneficial For Adults With ASD?</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of online therapy is that adults with ASD can stay in a familiar environment and focus on communication without the external demands of a foreign location. A recent review of the use of technology to facilitate learning in adults with ASD showed that computer-mediated communication allows for an increase of thinking time during conversations, an increase of control during conversations, a reduction of external sensory distractions, and an overall more comfortable environment. Technology-based interactions also decrease stress related to non-verbal communication such as eye contact, tone of voice, and body language.</p>
<p>Internet-based therapy has shown significant promise for many mental disorders, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), panic disorder, and many others. Because of the high rates of these conditions in adults with ASD, it is important that internet-based therapy programs are able to address multiple conditions.</p>
<p>Another benefit of internet-based therapy is that it can be tailored to the participant. For example, depending on the participant’s preferences, communication can be live (e.g., over video call or through live chat) or it can be over an asynchronous chat such as email. Therapeutic professionals are also able to tailor specific internet-based content to the needs of the participant.</p>
<p>Despite the high suitability of internet-based therapy for adults with ASD, there has historically been minimal research directly exploring its use in this context. Recent research studies have focused specifically on using internet-based therapy for patient populations with ASD, and the results have been promising.</p>
<p>In one study performed by Backmanet al., the feasibility of internet-based psycho-educative programs was studied for young adults and adolescents with ASD. In this study, participants reported positively about the program and clinicians felt that they were able to work with participants effectively through this medium of communication. In another study, Sehlin et al.investigated how young adults and adolescents with ASD felt about an internet-based program they participated in. Participants reported that they felt the coach was the most important part of the program, and they enjoyed communicating via written text and being able to complete the program at home. While these results are promising, the studies did not look at adults with ASD directly.</p>
<p>To design an appropriate program for adults with ASD, it is important to understand the needs of the specific patient population and preferences for the structure of the program. To do this, researchers performed a study to understand the experience of adults with ASD who participated in an individual internet-based therapy program with integrated group-based components.</p>
<h2>Results Of Internet-Based Therapy For Adults With ASD</h3>
<p>To understand the specific needs and preferences of adults with ASD when it comes to internet-based therapy, a qualitative interview study was performed to evaluate the experiences of participants who completed internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). To understand the experiences of participants, interviews were given, and participants were able to voice their experiences and insights.</p>
<h3>How WasThe ICBT Structured?</h3>
<p>The ICBT that participants completed within this study was an 18-week program specifically aimed at adults with ASD. The goals of this program were to increase the quality of everyday life through:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improving independent function and ability to complete daily tasks</li>
    <li>Improving self-acceptance</li>
    <li>Improving self-knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet-based program was created by adapting a manual called the Method for Internetbased treatment for Life quality of adults with Autism Spectrum disorder, or MILAS. This manual was converted into an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. During this program, participants were given weekly text-based modules based on weekly themes.</p>
<p>Examples of weekly themes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Individual goals
    <li>Behavioral analysis
    <li>Social interaction
    <li>Emotions and body language
    <li>Social anxiety
    <li>Depression
    <li>Central coherence
    <li>Other topics specific to the common needs of adults with ASD
</ul>
<p>To increase accessibility, all information was given in both text and audio formats.</p>
<p>For each module, therapists reviewed the submissions of each participant and provided feedback. Communication was asynchronous, and participants were able to write to the therapist at any time during the program with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>While the design of the program was specific to ASD, individual goals and needs were used to tailor the program slightly to the individual. In addition to the individual exercises, participants had the option of participating in group chat sessions with the other participants, led by therapists involved in the program.</p>
<h3>How Was The Internet-Based Cognitive Therapy Program Evaluated?</h3>
<p>After completion of the program, participants were interviewed about their experiences within the program and how they felt about different aspects. Participants were given semi-structured, open-ended interviews asking questions about 1) the participant’s experience within the program, 2) the program’s impact on self-perception, 3) experiences interacting with the therapists and other participants, and 4) thoughts and preferences regarding the design of the program.</p>
<h3>What Were The Results?</h3>
<p>Overall, adults with ASD who participated in the online cognitive behavioral therapy program were satisfied with it and found it to be beneficial. In line with previous findings regardinginternet-based therapies, the ability to complete the programs at home andin a self-paced manner was a big factor in program satisfaction. Participants also enjoyed the bi-weekly chat sessions to interact with other participants.</p>
<p>Multiple adults within this program preferred online-based therapy to in-person healthcare due to decreasedfeelings of stress and anxiety and an increased ability to focus on the treatment material without external distraction. The therapists within the program were also generally perceived to be competent, and interactionswere considered to be sufficient.</p>
<p>One place in which internet-based therapy may be improved is the individualization for participants. While in-person therapy delivered in real-time is usually tailored to the individual, online therapy often consists of modules that are made to fit the needs of the greater majority. This can be difficult for diverse groups. While the breadth generally meets the needs of the majority, tailoring the material to theindividual would decrease the completion of materials that are less relevant to them.</p>
<p>Several participants in this study said that they felt more comfortable without having to focus on body language and facial expressions during interactions. This lessens the likelihood of mental exhaustion and over-stimulation and increases the suitability of internet-based therapy for adults with ASD. For future studies, finding a balance between adequate support from therapists in the program while still providing the previously mentioned benefits will be important. It is also crucial for the therapists involved to have experience treating adults with ASD and to have an in-depth knowledge of the condition. This need was mentioned by multiple participants.</p>
<h2>Taking This Study Forward</h2>
<p>Overall, research in internet-based interventions both for mental health conditions in the general population and specifically for adults with ASD has shown great potential. Common barriers to access to health care for adults with ASD are addressed through internet-based therapy, such as less pressure on in-person interactions, more time and control during communications with therapists, lack of external distractions and decreased sensory overload, and the self-paced structure of the course.</p>
<p>In addition to these factors, adults with ASD who completed internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy felt that the program was able to significantly improve independence, quality of everyday life, and self-confidence. Interactions with therapists were considered to be useful and sufficient, and group activities provided an optional way to interact with other participants.</p>
<p>While more research needs to be done to confirm results and increase the individualization and availability of programs, results from these studies show significant promise for the use of internet-based therapy to help adults with ASD. Moving forward, this option should be prioritized and introduced to adult populations with ASD interested in how online cognitive behavioral therapy may benefit them.</p>
