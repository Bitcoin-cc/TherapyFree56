    <h1>Understanding Eating Disorders</h1>
    </header>


   
<article>
<h2>What are Eating Disorders?</h2>
<p/>According to the Mayo Clinic, "eating disorders are serious conditions related to persistent eating behaviors that negatively impact your health, your emotions and your ability to function in important areas of life. The most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder." Individuals suffering from eating disorders struggle with body image issues, which we call body dysmorphia. The individual is fixated on their weight, and is unable to see themselves in a realistic way, or eat in a balanced way.
<h2>Who Suffers from Eating Disorders?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Females (females suffer at a rate of 8:1 over males)
    <li>People who feel like their life is out of control
    <li>Victims of abuse (verbal, physical, sexual)
    <li>Overachievers
    <li>Teens and adults who were told they were fat as children
    <li>Someone suffering the sudden loss of a loved one
    <li>Individuals with anxiety or depression
    <li>Someone from a family that has pressures to be thin
    <li>Someone who is the genetic relative of someone with an eating disorder
    <li>Someone with low self esteem
    <li>Someone dealing with major life changes, such as going away to college
    <li>Someone facing issues with the Hypothalamus, as this controls hunger feelings
</ul>
<p/>What you should know:
<p/>Eating Disorders can literally be deadly to the person who is suffering from them. The individual can have a rupture in the esophagus when they purge. They can lose so much weight, that their system gives out. They can have a heart attack. People with these disorders are prone to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Eating disorders are quite serious, and require treatment as early as possible. If you suspect that you have, or that someone you love has an eating disorder, act on it.

<h2>Types of Eating Disorders</h2>
<h3>Anorexia</h3>
<p/>This is an eating disorder in which the individual withholds food from him or herself, eats far less than they need to sustain themselves, has a distorted body image they see in the mirror, and often engages in excessive exercise.
<h3>Bulimia</h3>
<p/>This is an eating disorder where the individual typically binges on food, and then purges up what they have eaten. These individuals will also use medications such as ex-lax, enemas and water pills, and/or go for walks or runs of excessive distance.
<h3>Binge Eating</h3>
<p/>This is uncontrollable over-eating. The individual can consume up to 5,000 calories in one sitting. They feel as if they are not able to stop on their own, and are not capable of controlling the eating. The episodes are frequent, and they feel guilt during and after the binge.
<h3>Emotional Eating</h3>
<p/>This is the most common eating disorder. It is when we try and use food to make us feel better about any given situation. People do it when they are stressed, when they are bored, when they are depressed, or to try and fill a void.

<h2>What are the most effective eating disorder treatments?</h2>
<p/>Fortunately, much progress has been made in the treatment of eating disorders. Although the exact treatment approach depends on the individual and which eating disorder they have, one or a combination of the following therapies may be used for most people suffering with eating disorders:
<ul>
    <li>Medication:Certain antidepressant drugs and anti-anxiety medications are used to treat the depression and anxiety associated with eating disorders. The anti-depressants can help with the depressive, hopeless, and suicidal thoughts. The anti-anxiety medication can help with the impulsivity, and to slow down their thoughts. Each individual should discuss with his or her doctor whether medications are recommended for his or her particular symptoms, and if so, which ones would be most suitable.
    <li>Psychotherapy:Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) addresses the emotional reasons the individual is struggling with their eating. This may include discussing low self-esteem, distorted body image, obsessions about their body, and hopeless thoughts. It is a process in which trained mental health professionals help people by talking through strategies for understanding and dealing with their disorder.
    <li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy: People suffering from eating disorders often participate in this type of psychotherapy in which the person learns to recognize and change thought patterns and behaviors that lead to anxious and depressed feelings, which in turn lead to disordered eating. Therapy also aims to identify possibly triggers, and learn to be able to tolerate their feelings and thoughts.
    <li>Nutritional Education and weight management:The individual will typically meet with a dietician who teaches and educates them about true healthy eating. They will likely be monitored during and after meals for a long time period, until things have stabilized, and trust has been built.
